## History

The first Gilde der Nacht association was founded in late autumn 2011 by 4 passionate Magic: The Gathering players and our events quickly developed into a popular meeting place for players from the region. 3 years later we realized that Magic isn't everything (don't get us wrong, Magic is a fantastic game - but sometimes we feel the need to make each other's lives hell with plastic miniatures or, thanks to some ingenious party game, wet our pants while laughing).

This is how a second association was created under the name of  _Element 15_. As this also rapidly grew in popularity, we decided to merge these two associations on 9 May 2015 and set ourselves the goal of making everyone happy; whether magic, strategy, party or role-players.
