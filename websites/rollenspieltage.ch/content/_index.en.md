_First time here? [Let us explain what role-playing games are.]({{< ref "roleplay" >}})_

Dear roleplayers, dear game masters, dear helpers

**We are pleased to announce that the Luzerner Rollenspieltage 2021 will take place.**

From 28.8.21 13:00 until 29.8.21 19:00 there will be a variety of tabletop roleplaying sessions – for all those who would like to set foot into the world of roleplaying, but also for experienced players who would like to try something new.

The Luzerner Rollenspieltage will be located at the Pfarrei St. Johannes at Schädrütistrasse 26 in 6006 Luzern (CH). Therefore, we will meet physically on site and not online. Food will be provided and participation is free of charge.

You can register for the roleplaying rounds with this [registration form]({{< ref "registration" >}}). If you would like to run a session as game master or support us as a helper, you can also register there.

Should the government adjust the measures for public events during August, we will inform you about a cancellation on 26.8.21 at the latest.

**We are looking forward seeing you!**

Information on how to get there can be found further down. If you have any questions, just get in touch with us via the [contact form]({{< ref "contact" >}}) or [live chat]({{< ref "livechat" >}}).
