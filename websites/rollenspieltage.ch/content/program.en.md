## What is Discord?

[Discord](https://discord.com/) is a free chat program that runs in a browser but can also be installed as an app (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS etc.). On our Discord server you will find several *channels*:

* Channels where you can register for the game rounds,
* a channel where you can contact us if you have problems with Discord or other related issues,
* game channels (text and audio channels) in which the games are being played,
* a channel for general chatting and exchanging with other players and the game masters,
* and a few more

It is important to us that Discord does not get in your way, but supports the experience of the Rollenspieltage as much as possible. So if you encounter any problems or questions, [don't hesitate to contact us]({{< ref "contact" >}}) so we can help you.
