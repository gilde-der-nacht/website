# Roleplaying

Dive with us into the infinite world of fantasy, where we will experience unique stories together. Wonderful stories that we spin together and leave decisions to luck every now and then, so that we can be surprised and entertained again and again.

If you have never played so called pen & paper role playing games before, you will find game masters with us who will support you in your first steps in this creative hobby with great commitment.

Who better to explain games to you than the people who developed them? With us you have the opportunity to discover brand new games and talk to the game designers:

## VIAE - Roads of Rome

_Saturday, 1–5 pm_

As Tribunes, you are set to conquer the world for the glory of Rome. Build  roads, smite your enemies, gain influence in the Senate. But watch your back, everyone has their own objectives and agendas. Your fellow Tribunes will aim to disrupt your goals. Treat them as a tool on your path to victory.

## Darwin’s Choice

_Sunday, 1–4 pm_

After millions of years of wasteland on Earth, animal life is finally emerging. But the world is still forming and undergoing a constant change. Only those species able to adapt to the ever-changing conditions will survive to leave their mark in history. Here is your chance! Do your best to become Darwin’s Choice.
